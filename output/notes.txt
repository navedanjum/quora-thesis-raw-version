You might have to regenerate the output , use GPu enabled/Cloud services as Trained models files
could take hours and days of computation on regular setup to generate output files

I have uploaded few of the models as it raw, due to space/storage constraints, few output models
cannot be uploaded.

Goodluck if you wish to continue or use the models for betterment or ideation for your work
